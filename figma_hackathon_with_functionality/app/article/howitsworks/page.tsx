        <p className='text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 text-[20px]'>At Morent, we strive to provide you with a seamless and reliable car rental experience. Here&#039;s a breakdown of how our service operates:</p>

                <li className='sm:text-2xl text-xl font-bold'><span className='text-primary'>1.</span> Car Registration</li>
                <p className='text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 text-[20px]'>Before a car becomes available for rental, it undergoes a thorough registration process. Owners interested in listing their vehicles on our platform register through our specialized service. We collect essential details about the vehicle, including its make, model, year, and current condition.</p>
            </ol>
            <ol className='space-y-3'>
                <li className='sm:text-2xl text-xl font-bold'><span className='text-primary'>2.</span> Quality Checks</li>
                <p className='text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 text-[20px]'>Ensuring your safety is our top priority. Hence, each registered car undergoes rigorous quality checks. Our trained technicians meticulously inspect every aspect of the vehicle to verify its roadworthiness. We examine engine performance, brake systems, tires, lights, and other crucial components to guarantee that the car meets our standards.</p>

                <p className='text-sm font-medium text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 text-[20px]'>Once a car successfully passes the quality checks, we provide comprehensive insurance coverage. This insurance protects both the owner and the renter against unforeseen accidents or damages during the rental period. We believe in offering peace of mind to both parties involved in the rental transaction.</p>
